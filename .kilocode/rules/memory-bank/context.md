# Context

## Current Work Focus

Initial project setup and core visualization foundation.

## Recent Changes

- Created VS Code extension project structure
- Implemented basic React Flow visualization with placeholder nodes
- Set up dual-mode webview (development with Vite HMR, production with static files)
- Configured Content Security Policy for both modes

## Next Steps

- Implement Payload CMS collection parsing
- Add relationship detection between collections
- Create configuration for Payload CMS project paths
- Build UI for connecting to existing Payload CMS projects
- Add interactive features for the visualization

## Current Limitations

- Only shows hardcoded placeholder nodes (Node 1, Node 2)
- No actual Payload CMS integration
- No collection schema parsing
- No relationship edge rendering from actual data
